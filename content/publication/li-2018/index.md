abstract: Predicting the time of stimulus onset is a key component in perception.
  Previous investigations of perceived timing have focused on the effect of stimulus
  properties such as rhythm and temporal irregularity, but the influence of non-temporal
  properties and their role in predicting stimulus timing has not been exhaustively
  considered. The present study aims to understand how a non-temporal pattern in a
  sequence of regularly timed stimuli could improve or bias the detection of temporal
  deviations. We presented interspersed sequences of 3, 4, 5, and 6 auditory tones
  where only the timing of the last stimulus could slightly deviate from isochrony.
  Participants reported whether the last tone was 'earlier' or 'later' relative to
  the expected regular timing. In two conditions, the tones composing the sequence
  were either organized into musical scales or they were random tones. In one experiment,
  all sequences ended with the same tone; in the other experiment, each sequence ended
  with a different tone. Results indicate higher discriminability of anisochrony with
  musical scales and with longer sequences, irrespective of the knowledge of the final
  tone. Such an outcome suggests that the predictability of non-temporal properties,
  as enabled by the musical scale pattern, can be a factor in determining the sensitivity
  of time judgments.
