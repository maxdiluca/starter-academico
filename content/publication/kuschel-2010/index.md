abstract: The compliance of a material can be conveyed through mechanical interactions
  in a virtual environment and perceived through both visual and haptic cues. We investigated
  this basic aspect of perception. In two experiments, subjects performed compliance
  discriminations, and the mean perceptual estimate (PSE) and the perceptual standard
  deviation (proportional to JND) were derived from psychophysical functions. Experiment
  1 supported a model in which each modality acted independently to produce a compliance
  estimate, and the two estimates were then integrated to produce an overall value.
  Experiment 2 tested three mathematical models of the integration process. The data
  ruled out exclusive reliance on the more reliable modality and stochastic selection
  of one modality. Instead, the results supported an integration process that constitutes
  a weighted summation of two random variables, which are defined by the single modality
  estimates. The model subsumes optimal fusion but provided valid predictions also
  if the weights were not optimal. Weights were optimal (i.e., minimized variance)
  when vision and haptic inputs were congruent, but not when they were incongruent.
