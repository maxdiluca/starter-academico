abstract: Roughness perception through fingertip contact with a textured surface can
  involve spatial and temporal cues from skin indentation and vibration respectively.
  Both types of cue may be affected by contact forces when feeling a surface and we
  ask whether, on a given trial, discrimination performance relates to contact forces.
  We examine roughness discrimination performance in a standard psychophysical method
  (2-interval forced choice, in which the participant identifies which of two spatial
  textures formed by parallel grooves feels rougher) while continuously measuring
  the normal and tangential forces applied by the index finger. Fourteen participants
  discriminated spatial gratings in fine (spatial period of 320--580 micron) and coarse
  (1520--1920 micron) ranges using static pressing or sliding contact of the index
  finger. Normal contact force (mean and variability) during pressing or sliding had
  relatively little impact on accuracy of roughness judgments except when pressing
  on surfaces in the coarse range. Discrimination was better for sliding than pressing
  in the fine but not the coarse range. In contrast, tangential force fluctuations
  during sliding were strongly related to roughness judgment accuracy.
