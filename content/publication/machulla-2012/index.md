abstract: Recent studies show that repeated exposure to an asynchrony between auditory
  and visual stimuli shifts the point of subjective simultaneity. Usually, the measurement
  stimuli used to assess this aftereffect are interleaved with short re-exposures
  to the asynchrony. In a first experiment, we show that the aftereffect declines during
  measurement in spite of the use of re-exposures. In a second experiment, we investigate
  whether the observed decline is either due to a dissipation of the aftereffect with
  the passage of time, or the result of using measurement stimuli with a distribution
  of asynchronies different from the exposure stimulus. To this end, we introduced
  a delay before measuring the aftereffects and we compared the magnitude of the aftereffect
  with and without delay. We find that the aftereffect does not dissipate during the
  delay but instead is stored until new sensory information in the form of measurement
  stimuli is presented as counterevidence (i.e., stimuli with an asynchrony that differs
  from the one used during exposure). Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.
