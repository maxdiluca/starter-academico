abstract: We propose a haptic system that applies forces or skin deformation to the
  user's arm, rather than at the fingertips, for believable interaction with virtual
  objects as an alternative to complex thimble devices. Such a haptic system would
  be able to convey information to the arm instead of the fingertips, even though
  the user manipulates virtual objects using their hands. We developed a set of haptic
  sketches to determine which directions of skin deformation are deemed more believable
  during a grasp and lift task. Subjective reports indicate that normal forces were
  the most believable feedback to represent this interaction.
