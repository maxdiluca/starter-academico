 abstract = {attribute values correlates with expert similarity assessments (a method that does not scale). Our analysis also highlights an inher- ent trade-off between simulation sickness and accessibility across LTs. As such, Locomotion Vault shows to be a tool that unifies information on LTs and enables their standardization and large- scale comparison to help understand the space of possibilities in VR locomotion.},
