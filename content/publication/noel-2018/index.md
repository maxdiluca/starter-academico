abstract: It has been suggested that the integration of multiple body-related sources
  of information within the peri-personal space (PPS) scaffolds body ownership. However,
  a normative computational framework detailing the functional role of PPS is still
  missing. Here we cast PPS as a visuo-proprioceptive Bayesian inference problem whereby
  objects we see in our environment are more likely to engender sensations as they
  come near to the body. We propose that PPS is the reflection of such an increased
  a priori probability of visuo-proprioceptive coupling that surrounds the body. To
  test this prediction, we immersed participants in a highly realistic virtual reality
  (VR) simulation of their right arm and surrounding environment. We asked participants
  to perform target-directed reaches toward visual, proprioceptive, and visuo-proprioceptive
  targets while visually displaying their reaching arm (body visible condition) or
  not (body invisible condition). Reach end-points are analyzed in light of the coupling
  prior framework, where the extension of PPS is taken to be represented by the spatial
  dispersion of the coupling prior between visual and proprioceptive estimates of
  arm location. Results demonstrate that if the body is not visible, the spatial dispersion
  of the visuo-proprioceptive coupling relaxes, whereas the strength of coupling remains
  stable. By demonstrating a distance-dependent alteration in visual and proprioceptive
  localization attractive pull toward one another (stronger pull at small spatial
  discrepancies) when the body is rendered invisible -- an effect that is well accounted
  for by the visuo-proprioceptive coupling prior -- the results suggest that the visible
  body grounds visuo-proprioceptive coupling preferentially in the near vs. far space.
