abstract: How humans perform duration judgments with multisensory stimuli is an ongoing
  debate. Here, we investigated how sub-second duration judgments are achieved by
  asking participants to compare the duration of a continuous sound to the duration
  of an empty interval in which onset and offset were marked by signals of different
  modalities using all combinations of visual, auditory and tactile stimuli. The pattern
  of perceived durations across five stimulus durations (ranging from 100. ms to 900.
  ms) follows the Vierordt Law. Furthermore, intervals with a sound as onset (audio-visual,
  audio-tactile) are perceived longer than intervals with a sound as offset. No modality
  ordering effect is found for visualtactile intervals. To infer whether a single
  modality-independent or multiple modality-dependent time-keeping mechanisms exist
  we tested whether perceived duration follows a summative or a multiplicative distortion
  pattern by fitting a model to all modality combinations and durations. The results
  confirm that perceived duration depends on sensory latency (summative distortion).
  Instead, we did not find evidence for multiplicative distortions. The results of
  the model and the behavioural data support the concept of a single time-keeping
  mechanism that allows for judgments of durations marked by multisensory stimuli.
