abstract: We present Tactile Echoes, a wearable system for augmenting tactile interactions
  with any object. This system senses vibrations in the fingertip that are produced
  by interactions of the finger with a touched object. It processes the vibration
  signals in real-time via a parametric signal network and returns them to the finger
  as "Tactile Echoes" of the touch interaction. Just as acoustic echoes continuously
  respond to sound, Tactile Echoes are continuously generated in response to the sensed
  tactile contacts. A short finger tap produces discrete Echoes, while a slide can
  yield continuous feedback. We also render the signals as sound, yielding multisensory
  feedback. Many different effects can be designed using ten signal processing parameters.
  Distinct effects may be assigned to different touched objects or surface regions
  by sensing the hand location in a mapped environment. We investigated how Tactile
  Echoes are perceived in a behavioral study using semantic differential scaling and
  multidimensional scaling methods. This yielded low-dimensional, semantically grounded
  representations of the perceptual similarities between different Echoes. This system
  holds promise for enabling evocative haptic effects during a wide range of free-hand
  tactile interactions.
